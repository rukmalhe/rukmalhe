## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- My key focus is enabling seamless CI/CD pipelines that integrate automated tests at every stage of the development lifecycle, leveraging my expertise in Java, Python, AWS Code commit, Azure Pipelines and various test automation tools like Junit, Selenium, TestNG, Playwright, Rest Assured. With a deep understanding of both functional and non-functional testing principles, I aim to elevate software quality, optimize testing processes, and reduce time to market.
