## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My key focus is enabling **seamless CI/CD pipelines** that integrate **automated tests** at every stage of the development lifecycle, leveraging my expertise in **Java**, **Python**, **AWS CodeCommit**, **Azure Pipelines**, and various **test automation tools** like **JUnit**, **Selenium**, **TestNG**, **Playwright**, and **Rest Assured**.  
- With a deep understanding of both **functional** and **non-functional testing principles**, I aim to **elevate software quality**, **optimize testing processes**, and **reduce time to market**.
